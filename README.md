# PIC-Simulation
### Author: Antoine Cerfon and Nigel Shen

This is a Particle-In-Cell code. We have code for 1 and 2 dimensions. In each folder named PICnD, the main file is picnd.py where n is the dimension. We also have a modified Particle-In-Fourier version, whose main file is pifnd.py.

In the Initialize.py file, just choose your initial condition to import, which are located in the InitialConditions folder (so far we have LandauDamping.py for the Landau Damping problem, and a ManufacturedSolution1.py for manufactured solution tests).
